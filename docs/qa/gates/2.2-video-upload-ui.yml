  Round 2 Incremental Review PASSED.

  All 4 issues from Round 1 have been resolved:
  1. Test framework installed (vitest, @vue/test-utils, happy-dom)
  2. Test scripts configured (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
  3. 103 comprehensive tests created across 4 test files
  4. Dev log created with full implementation documentation

  Test Coverage:
  - useVideoUpload.spec.ts: 35 tests (composable logic)
  - VideoUploader.spec.ts: 19 tests (drag-drop component)
  - UploadProgress.spec.ts: 28 tests (progress tracking)
  - VideoList.spec.ts: 21 tests (video grid display)

  All blind spot scenarios are now covered with explicit test cases.
  Story is ready for commit and handoff to SM.
